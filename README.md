# JavaScript Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on JavaScript practice focused on **core language fundamentals** and **data structures & algorithms (DSA)**.  
The goal is to build strong problem-solving habits and clear understanding of JavaScript behavior through small, focused files.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for running files locally)

## Repository Structure
- `variable.js` - Variable declarations (`const`, `let`, `var`) and basic state updates.
- `datatypes.js` - Primitive types, `typeof`, and `null` behavior.
- `convertion and operation.js` - Type conversion, operators, implicit coercion, increment operations.
- `comparison.js` - Comparison operators and edge cases with `null` and string-number comparisons.
- `dsa-practice.js` - Beginner DSA implementations:
  - Stack (LIFO)
  - Queue (FIFO)
  - Reverse string using stack logic
  - Balanced parentheses checker
- `type.js` - Reserved for additional type-related exercises.

## What I Am Practicing
- JavaScript execution and type system basics
- Equality and relational comparison behavior
- Clean coding habits with small testable examples
- DSA fundamentals with practical class-based implementations

## Run Locally
1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run any file:

```bash
node dsa-practice.js
node comparison.js
```

## Sample Learning Focus
- Why `typeof null` returns `"object"`
- Difference between `==` and `>=` with `null`
- How stack and queue operations map to real interview questions

## Next Improvements
- Add problem-by-problem folders (arrays, strings, recursion, linked list)
- Add unit tests for DSA utilities
- Add complexity notes (`O(n)`, `O(1)`) for each method
- Improve file naming consistency
